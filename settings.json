  // Configuration for Discord role-based permissions.
  // This section outlines the hierarchy of roles in relation to game moderation commands. Each role is associated with specific privileges, creating a tiered access structure. 
  // - The 'silence' role represents the most basic level of moderation authority, permitting users only to silence other players.
  // - Users with the 'kick' role inherit 'silence' permissions and additionally have the ability to remove players from the game temporarily.
  // - The 'ban' role is the highest level of authority, encompassing all lower-tier permissions and exclusively allowing the permanent removal of players from the game.
  // It's possible to assign the same Discord role to multiple tiers, effectively granting that role the combined permissions of those tiers.
